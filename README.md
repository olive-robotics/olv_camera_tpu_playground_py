2	rightEye
3	leftEar
4	rightEar
5	leftShoulder

# 3- Gesture Recognition App
An exmaple of showing how to use MLP neural network model to train gesture classes.

### ROS2 topic
The detection result will be published on the topic "/gesturerecognition"
With "ros2 topic list" or "ros2 topic echo /gesturerecognition" it can be checked whether a message is published to verify that the device is working.

### Gestures
The following gestures can be used by default

1) Both hands down
2) Both hands up
3) Left down / right up
4) Right down / left up
